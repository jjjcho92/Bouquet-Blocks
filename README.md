Connections Lab Project 2: Bouquet Blocks w/ Kat 


## Link to the project: 
- Github Repo (Kat's):  https://github.com/KatJPark/Bouquet-Blocks 
- Glitch Site: https://sheer-alpine-dill.glitch.me/
- Glitch Editor Link: https://glitch.com/edit/#!/sheer-alpine-dill 


## Key concept(s) and/or intention(s) driving the project:
- This is Kat's concept and idea: “Bouquet Party” 
- Rearranging & building blocks however you want. When finish and submit, the site will show a collection of bouquet from all other participants together with yours. Not sure where she got the inspiration, but I found it really poetic. 


## Production decisions (i.e. technical, design, creative, etc.)
- Kat made a full architecture notes and data flow notes for us to follow, which was super helpful.
- Here's the Figma link: https://www.figma.com/file/yTfXlbEXhnmYVPGhuU1TqI/Connections-Lab-Project-2?node-id=0%3A1 

- The design is simple and colorful, the tools we used during production are: p5, neDB, node, express. Was thinking about Socket.io as well, but didn't get to use it duuring this stage of the production.


## Major challenges and solutions
- I had an unplanned surgery, so I had to miss the class during the first project presentation. It was also uncertain if I would be recovered enough over the weekend to work on the project. 
- There's also a huge time zone difference between Kat and I. 
- Turned out I was able to work on the project despite the pain of the surgery recovery. However, it was also only possible and smooth becasue Kat did such an amazing job in setting up the flow of the project. With the wireframe she created, I was able to follow the idea easily while working on p5. And with constant communcation via Discord and Text messages, Kat and I were able to divide the work quite well. 
- I wasn't sure how to work on the same codes together without conflict at first. Elizebeth's Flyby really came in handy! I'm now much less afraid about pull requests, and even found it fun!
- When I encountered challenge in p5...I also messaged my ex-bf for help lol He's a js maniac, who just loves solving js problems for people. He even helped Siri, who is a total strange to him, during the create-a-thon lol So, also thanks to my ex's generosity and speedy response rate. 



## Lessons learned as well as potential next steps if work on the project continues
- Make the triangles work as well in p5
- Maybe have some more layering ability with the shapes
- Figure out how to show the gallery in grid
- Also figure out how to not have the gallery full with repetitive images
- add music
- I'm not sure I fully understand how the db works yet (since Kat did all the heavy lyfting on that part), will probably have to rewatch the videos to learn how to do all that again. 

## Any relevant references/resources
- p5 Draggable Sample Code provided by Nun: https://editor.p5js.org/icm/sketches/BkRHbimhm
- My ex-bf (seriously). His name is Lu-Yi, so if he ever apply to the program in future, please make sure to accept him. 
- Kat might have some other references and resources that I'm not aware of.
